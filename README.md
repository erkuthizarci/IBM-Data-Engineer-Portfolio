## 🛠️ IBM Data Engineering Professional Project
This folder contains my work and capstone projects from the IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate. It demonstrates a full-cycle mastery of data architecture, including relational databases, NoSQL, ETL pipelines, and Big Data processing.

🚀 Skills & Competencies
Through this curriculum, I have developed a deep understanding of the data engineering lifecycle:

Relational Databases (RDBMS): Designing and managing schemas with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and IBM DB2.

NoSQL Solutions: Handling unstructured data using MongoDB and Apache Cassandra.

ETL & Data Pipelines: Automating data extraction, transformation, and loading using Python and Apache Airflow.

Big Data & Cloud: Processing massive datasets with Apache Spark and managing cloud infrastructure on IBM Cloud.

📁 Projects Included
1. Relational Database Design & SQL
Created entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) to model business requirements.

Optimized query performance using indexing and normalization.

2. NoSQL Database Management
Implemented document-based storage in MongoDB for flexible data schemas.

Configured column-family stores in Cassandra for high-availability workloads.

3. ETL Pipeline Automation
Built automated pipelines to pull data from diverse sources (APIs, CSVs, SQL) and load them into a centralized Data Warehouse.

Monitored workflow health and task dependencies using Apache Airflow.

4. Big Data with Apache Spark
Conducted data transformation at scale using Spark SQL and DataFrames.

Analyzed large-scale log files and real-time streaming data.

🛠️ Tools Used
Languages: Python, SQL, Bash.

Platforms: IBM Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes.

Orchestration: Apache Airflow.
