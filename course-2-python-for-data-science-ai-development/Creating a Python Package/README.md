# Creating a Python Package & Code Quality Lab

This section of the portfolio demonstrates the transition from writing basic scripts to building professional, modular Python libraries.

## 📂 Project Structure
* **mymath/**: A custom Python package containing modules for basic and statistical mathematics.
* **static_analysis/**: Labs focused on improving code quality using `pylint`.

## 🛠️ Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Modular Programming**: Implementing `__init__.py` to create a recognizable Python package structure.
* **Static Code Analysis**: Using `pylint` to identify PEP 8 violations and refactor code for better maintainability.
* **Quality Assurance**: Improving a "Bad Score" script into a "Good Score" script through documentation and naming convention fixes.

## 🚀 How to Use the Package
The modules can be imported into other scripts using:
```python
from mymath import basic, stats
